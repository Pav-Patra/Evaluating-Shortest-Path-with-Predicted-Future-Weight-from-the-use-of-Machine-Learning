# cs310---Evaluating-Shortest-Path-with-Predicted-Future-Weight-from-the-use-of-Machine-Learning
This report looks at the development of a directed weighted graph traversal algorithm whereby any two selected nodes are traversed along their calculated shortest path. This graph is unique in that edge connections and edge weights may be altered in real-time, therefore impacting potential shortest paths.
